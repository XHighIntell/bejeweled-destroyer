# Anniversary
12 years ago, the first time I knew about the Win32 API and used them in Visual Basic 6. I wrote a bot tool to play Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook to show off to friends. 12 years passed, I didn't realize that stupid joy created me today.

Today, I rewrote the same tool but in C# to remember that day.
